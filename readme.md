# advent of code

## 2022

trying to do solutions in ocaml 🗣️

(using the [Base](https://github.com/janestreet/base) standard library to make my life easier)

## 2023

solutions in kotlin, pretty cool language if you ask me 😎

all solutions done with two stars 🔥 (except day 25, that doesn't have a 2nd part)

## 2024

solutions in rust, it's memory safe and blazingly fast, btw 🦀

ran with [`audit`](https://github.com/DuroCodes/audit) to refactor the code after initial solution

also got #1 in the jetbrains rust leaderboard, so that's cool i think 🗣️

## 2025

solutions in rust yet again, year of the crab or whatever 🦀
